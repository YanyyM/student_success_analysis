# 🎓 Student Success Analysis: R + SQL Project

This project explores the **factors that influence student salary outcomes** after graduation using data from the [Campus Placement Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement). It applies both **SQL and R** to analyze the impact of academic performance, employability scores, and work experience on salary.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Investigate the relationship between **employability test scores** and salary
- Determine if **work experience** significantly affects salary outcomes
- Explore whether there is a **gender wage gap** in placement results
- Identify correlations between academic performance and salary
- Demonstrate proficiency in **SQL querying**, **statistical modeling**, and **data visualization** using R

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **R** (tidyverse, DBI, ggplot2)
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- **RMarkdown** (for the report)
- **GitHub** (for version control)

## 🔍 Key Methods & Skills

- SQL data aggregation and filtering (`GROUP BY`, `AVG()`, `JOIN`)
- Linear regression using `lm()`
- Hypothesis testing with `t.test()`
- Correlation analysis using `cor()`
- Data visualization with `ggplot2`
- Integrating SQL + R with `DBI` and `RPostgres`
